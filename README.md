This is one of their best songs ... like ever

There are other translations out there, but they're wrong

It's not their own lyrics, its an old poem written by a woman

But they usually don't change pronouns in urdu songs when its a poem so that's why the translations are not correct

The face/expression was mine (the woman is saying this)

The look (like the person was looking at me) was his

In the quietness e.g. in the no talking

There was a conversation

On my face there was a ghazal (a poem) being written

By what his eyes were saying (his eyes were writing a sher=poem)

It's so difficult to translate this bc its poetry but that's the general idea

T-Pain falling in love with a stripper cant come close to this lol
